Description: Tools implementing an automated version of the graphic double integration technique (GDI) for volume implementation, and some other related utilities for paleontological image-analysis. GDI was first employed by Jerison (1973) <ISBN:9780323141086> and Hurlburt (1999) <doi:10.1080/02724634.1999.10011145> and is primarily used for volume or mass estimation of (extinct) animals. The package 'gdi' aims to make this technique as convenient and versatile as possible. The core functions of 'gdi' provide utilities for automatically measuring diameters from digital silhouettes provided as image files and calculating volume via graphic double integration with simple elliptical, superelliptical (following Motani 2001 <doi:10.1666/0094-8373(2001)027%3C0735:EBMFST%3E2.0.CO;2>) or complex cross-sectional geometries (see also Zhao 2024 <doi:10.7717/peerj.17479>). Additionally, the package provides functions for estimating the center of mass position (COM), the moment of inertia (I) for 3D shapes and the second moment of area (Ix, Iy, Iz) of 2D cross-sections, as well as for the visualization of results.
